# WEEK 2 #

This week assignment was: `Predicting stock market using atleast 3 regression techniques using Keras`
### Data Used ###
I used Google stock data from [this](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/history?p=GOOG) site.


### Models Used ###

In my assignment i have used 6 regression techniques:
 1. Lasso Lars CV
 2. Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
 3. Gradient Boosting Regressor
 4. Bagging Regressor
 5. MLP Regressor
 6. LSTM 
 
## Things that can be done more ###
- [ ] Linking Sentiments with tweets to predict which stock is better
- [ ] Real time stock prediction with a chatbot suggesting when to buy and sell the stocks
